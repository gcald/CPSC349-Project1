        <p>This picture is one of my dogs. I like it because I have always been
        a very big pet guy, so when I see this picture, it reminds me of home</p>

          This is a picture of when I went to the CSUF Orientation (I think).
          I chose this picture because it reminds me of when I started college
          and how much out of my comfort zone I was. Although I was smiling, you
          can tell that I look really awkward and somewhat uncomfortable. I feel
          like that is how I felt a lot when I first came to CSUF as everything
          seemed so new to me. In the end, though, I'm proud of this photo because
          it was one of the first few times where I learned to embrace the awkwardness,
          rather than avoid it, and I ended up having a great time.

        <p> I also chose this picture because I think it really showcases my kind
          of humor as a kid, and even today. Not only did I meet the legendary Hannah
          Montanna, but I also was rocking a funky hairstyle too.<p>
