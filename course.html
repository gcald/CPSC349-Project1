      <h1>Why I'm in this course</h1>
      <section>
          <h3> Experience with Web Development</h3>
          <p>I'm taking this course because I always wanted to formally learn
            front-end web engineering. I have been interested in HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript ever since I got my hands on my first laptop. I remember
            creating HTML files that said "Hello World" over and over again as a kid.
            HTML was the easiest part for me to learn, but after that, I struggled.
            CSS and Javascript both seemed like huge monsters to tackle as
            a twelve year old, but, nonetheless, I tried and failed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I slowly began to grasp more and more CSS, but I haven't
            focused as much on Javascript, so I guess that's what made me want to
            take this class. I now work a job in back-end PHP programming, so now
            that I know a lot more about the back-end, I figured its time to give
            he front-end another shot.

        <h3>What I Hope to Learn</h3>
        <p>In this class, I hope to learn a few things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Javascript - I hope to learn the basics of Javascript
                in hopes that it will give me a very solid foundation in future
                Javascript projects.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Frameworks - I hope to learn a lot more about Javascript frameworks.
                Everytime I've tried to learn a JS framework, I always fail because I
                don't really know the basics of JS. I've been to hackathons in which
                I had to work with JS or React, and so far, its been very intimidating
                to learn. So in this course, I hope that I can leave this class
                feeling confident, not only in the framework we learn in class, but
                also in learning new frameworks such as Vue.js or React.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                HTML - Although I feel the most comfortable with HTML,
                I really want to know when and why to use certain tags over others.
                Most of what I learned from HTML was through self-teaching based off of
                resources I found online when I was much younger, so I think
                learning it properly will be good. I also think it will be very interesting
                to see what I have been doing wrong my whole life and what I got right.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                CSS - I have always struggled with CSS as it tends to be very finicky
                whenever I try to use it, but over time, I've gotten it to do what
                what I want. I hope that by taking this course it will help me understand
                why I've always had difficulty in styling a page just how I like
                it as I'm sure most things I do in CSS might not be the best way
                to go about it.
